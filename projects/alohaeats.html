 <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Aloha Eats is a web application designed for both vendors and customers in the food industry at UH Manoa. The application focuses on displaying various food items from different vendors, along with the capability for users to set their cuisine and dietary preferences.</p>

<h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>
<p><strong>Food Item Management</strong>: Admin users have the ability to add, edit, or delete food items. Each food item includes details such as name, quantity, cuisine type, availability, and dietary options.</p>

<p><strong>User Preferences</strong>: Users can set their cuisine and dietary preferences. These preferences are then used to filter the displayed food items, ensuring a personalized experience.</p>

<p><strong>Vendor Management</strong>: Vendors can manage their information and food items. This includes editing details about their offerings and updating their menus.</p>

<p><strong>Map Integration</strong>: The application includes a map feature that shows the location of various vendors, enhancing the user experience by providing geographical context.</p>
