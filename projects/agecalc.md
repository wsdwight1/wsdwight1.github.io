The age calculator is a simple C program that will calculate the user's age. The program asks for the user to enter the month, day, and year they were born. Unfortunately, the current date is set by variables in the main method. Although this could be easily modified to let the user input as well.

While this was not a terribly difficult program to write, it helped refresh my knowledge of C, use of classes, functions, and header files.
