In March 2022, I was fortunate enough to participate as an active duty representative for my unit in the Army at a Veteran Fundraiser. Two of my buddies and I drove from Savannah, GA where I was stationed to Graham, TX. Over the course of three days, we helped teach safety procedures for aerial hog hunting and answered any questions of participants. Hogs are a notoriously invasive species, and we helped erradicate them from local ranch owners while simultaneously raising funds for the Warrior Connection and Warrior Ranch.
